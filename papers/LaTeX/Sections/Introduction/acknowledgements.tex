We would like to offer our sincere thanks to our supervisor Axel Legay for proposing us this exciting thesis topic. Throughout this work, he provided us with continuous support and essential guidelines when we needed them the most. Similarly, special thanks to his assistant Thomas Given-Wilson for answering our different requests and ensuring the communication with Cisco. We would also like to thank Kim Mens for his time and expertise as last member of our jury.

More personally, we would like to express our gratitude to our family and friends for motivating us all along this pathway. Thank you for your support and for taking good care of us. Special thanks also to Beno√Æt-Xavier Dallemagne for his careful rereading and his judicious advice in terms of machine learning.
