Developer documentation
=======================

Welcome to the developer documentation! This section serves as a reference for people willing to contribute to the project.
First of all, thank you for wanting to make Manalyze better! During the course of this chapter, we will discuss considerations which should be taken into account before submitting code. Then we'll look at how the code is organized and formatted in the project. Finally, we'll look at the two ways this project can be extended: by writing a plugin to add analysis capabilities and by improving the core of the tool.

In this chapter, it is assumed that you have obtained a copy of the program's source code and know how to build it. If it is not the case, please refer to the :doc:`obtaining the tool </obtaining-manalyze>` page.
