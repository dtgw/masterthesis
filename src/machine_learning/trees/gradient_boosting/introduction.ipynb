    "Principle : In contrast to the random forest approach, gradient boosting works by building trees in a serial man‚Äê ner, where each tree tries to correct the mistakes of the previous one. By default, there is no randomization in gradient boosted regression trees; instead, strong pre-pruning is used. Gradient boosted trees often use very shallow trees, of depth one to five, which makes the model smaller in terms of memory and makes predictions faster. Each tree can only provide good predictions on part of the data, and so more and more trees are added to iteratively improve performance."
